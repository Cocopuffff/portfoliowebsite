			"I've worked in Shanghai, China as a Sales Manager for five years. In my previous role, I successfully collaborated with a developer and played a pivotal round in implementing a cloud ERP solution, which enhanced customer order management, drove inter-departmental data transparency, and improving operational efficiency. This experience has motivated me to move back to Singapore to transition into tech. I have worked on a variety of projects and I'm proud of the progress I've made since starting my coding journey in Dec 2022. Many of these projects are open-source and available for others to explore and contribute to. If you know of any exciting web development opportunities or have any advice to share, please feel free to reach out. Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities together!",
